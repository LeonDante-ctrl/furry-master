    <h2>I've been going at this for the past 3/4 years as a <span>pentester</span> and <span>it's been quite the experience, both on the learning end as well as helping me understand more and more what i wanted to focus on.</span> If you have an interest in either coding or fitness . Im a jack of all trades and would love to inspire more and more people to jump into this</h2>
    <p>The reason i threw this website up in the first place is to set up a point of referral for those who would need to reach out for tips to get to where ive gotten in both industries and soon i will be uploading an nft of my own that would ease the trouble of getting to any of my pages</p>
